<p>I'm a Computer Science student at UC Davis with a strong interest in problem-solving and low-level programming. I enjoy diving deep into languages like C, C++, and Python, and I’ve worked on projects ranging from floating-point emulation to web portals with user authentication. Beyond coding, I like to stay active—whether it’s exercising, exploring new places, or solving different types of Rubik’s cubes. I also enjoy playing chess and taking on challenges that push me to think critically and creatively.</p>
<p>My passion for technology and problem-solving extends to my academic pursuits. I’m currently taking courses in data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture, where I’m honing my skills in low-level programming and understanding how computers work at a fundamental level. I thrive on challenges and enjoy collaborating with others to tackle complex problems.</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I serve as a Resident Advisor, where I support a diverse group of residents and help foster a welcoming and inclusive community. I’ve also volunteered to teach math and Rubik’s Cube solving to younger students, which has been incredibly rewarding. Writing my book Master the Stroke: The Power of Persistence taught me the value of resilience, and I'm passionate about making a difference—whether through food recovery initiatives, peer support, or academic collaboration. I’m always looking for ways to grow, both personally and professionally.</p>
